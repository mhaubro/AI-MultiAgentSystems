#To be included by top-level makefile
#Crudely just compiles all .cpp files int this directory into a single executable
#We can go over to compiling .o files and linking afterwards, but this doesn't seem reasonable,
#as everything is C++11


#Also sets an include directory, which can be expanded.
#searchClientDirectory is inherited from makefile above
