NotHards client to search multi and single agent levels!

Compilation is done by running 'make' in this directory. The binary, called searcher, is created in the folder bin.
Compilation tested on Arch linux and ubuntu.

The client takes one input; the amount of memory in MB. We recommend running at 1500. Running it on the competition server would then be e.g.
java -jar
