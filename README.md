# AIMAS

Added from last time:C++ conversion

Run by e.g. doing ./runSearchClient level (Without extension), so fx ./runSearchClient SAsoko2_48

Design choices changed: Everything is now x and y, there is no col and row left except where things are initialized.

Build by using "make", "make all" will also build auxiliary programs, which is also okay. Clean by using "make clean".

More info to be added.
